NAME
    MooseX::Types::LoadableClass - ClassName type constraint with coercion
    to load the class.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyClass;
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Types::LoadableClass qw/ LoadableClass /;

        has foobar_class => (
            is => 'ro',
            required => 1,
            isa => LoadableClass,
            coerce => 1,
        );

        MyClass->new(foobar_class => 'FooBar'); # FooBar.pm is loaded or an
                                                # exception is thrown.

DESCRIPTION
        use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

        my $tc = subtype as ClassName;
        coerce $tc, from Str, via { Class::MOP::load_class($_); $_ };

    I've written those three lines of code quite a lot of times, in quite a
    lot of places.

    Now I don't have to.

TYPES EXPORTED
  LoadableClass
    A normal class / package.
