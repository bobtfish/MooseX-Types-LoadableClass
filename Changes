  - 'ClassName' is now exactly the same as 'LoadableClass', so that old code
    still works if you use a custom type map of 'LoadableClass' for
    MX::Storage/Kioku etc.
    (Note that they should normally work anyway with a default type map, as
    they subtype "normal" ClassName which subtypes Str)

  - Change the name to 'LoadableClass' as this is what people expect.
    The old 'ClassName' export is still present for backwards compatibility,
    but no longer documented.
